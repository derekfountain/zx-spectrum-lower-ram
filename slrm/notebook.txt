SRAM used is the IS65C256AL 32K x 8bit. CY62256 is an option, but a
bit more expensive.

Latch is 74HCT574. Identical to the 373, but the 574 has inputs on one side
and outputs on the other, which makes latching and passing through a
bus a lot easier to lay out.


ZX Write
========

RAS falls - we have min tRAH (20ns) to latch it
<275ns>
WRITE falls - it will stay down for min tWP (45ns)
<100ns>
CAS falls.
CAS address will stay available for tAR-tRCD(max) (95ns-50ns) is min 45ns.

Data will stay on the bus for min 45ns after CAS falls.

SRAM: Write cycle 1: CE, WR and addr can all go low at once, with
data input valid at that point. OE not used, can be either.

SRAM: Write cycle 2: CE remains low. OE goes high same time as address
appears. WR goes low at same time, or shortly after, with data valid at
that point.

SRAM: Write cycle 3: CE and OE remain low. Address and WR appear at the
same time, with data valid at that point.


ZX Read
=======

RAS falls - we have min tRAH (20ns) to latch it
<100ns>
CAS falls - it will be there for min tCAH (45ns)
We have a max of tCAC (100ns) to get the data onto the data bus
Can't work out how long it needs to be there.
<200ns>
CAS rises
<50ns>
CAS falls
<75ns>
RAS rises
<120ns>
RAS falls
CAS rises
<75ns>
CAS falls
<200ns>
CAS rises

Important point here is that from CAS going low, the SRAM needs
to have the data on the bus inside 100ns.
