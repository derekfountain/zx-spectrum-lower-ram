The 74HCT574 flip flop latch has footprint:
 Package_SO:SOIC-20W_7.5x12.8mm_P1.27mm
I'm working with the SN74HCT574NSR variant of the IC which is 5.6mm wide.
Hence that footprint needs to be:
 Package_SO:SO-20_5.3x12.6mm_P1.27mm

The board works, but "sparkles" appear on the Spectrum's screen. The Z80
is happy and all tests pass, but the ULA has some different, unspecified
requirements. Lots of experimentation suggests the SRAM's data needs to
be held on the data bus for a few nanoseconds after !CAS has gone high.
In theory the transaction is over by that point, but clearly something
isn't quite meeting requirements.

So I'm going to break the direct link between !CAS and the SRAM's !OE
and introduce a delay on the CAS line. It'll fire later, but also
delay the rising of CAS.

I changed the silkscreen labelling without changing the schematic, which
was a bit dumb. Need to fix that.

I need to get the signals from underneath the inverter where possible.
I had to take the IC off to cut some tracks.
